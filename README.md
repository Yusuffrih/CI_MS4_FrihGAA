![Am I responsive image to go here]()

FrihGAA is my final project for the Code Institute's Professional Diploma. It is a Web Application for a fictional GAA club that satisfies the requirements of this assessment. The brief provided for this project in the Assessment handbook was to 

*"build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. You will set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service."*
